Expert Analytics O&amp;G repo

Welcome to Expert Analytics' O&G dedicated repo :fuelpump: This will be the central point where we gather documentation, presentations and resources. In the following links you will find some useful resources for our work:

[O&G for dummies](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1XoAf6mMP5Svg6K9YkW4pNKD39FsSrckQ): a folder for those of us with no previous O&G knowledge. It is frustrating not to understand the petroleum language spoken in meetings and the concepts mentioned in there. To help cope with that and get you a head-start I have compiled links, useful info, and a dictionary I made myself “plain English - Petroleum”. <br><br>
[O&G literature](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1sdexOn1ShxqRZCuvz0udlEezgzfmhQac): if you cannot sleep and want to read literature about multiphase flow, rock mechanics, the IPR relations, or suddenly you need to know what are the exact components of the primary barrier in a well. <br><br>
[Sales presentations](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1VqlMz1RJ3KFpNnLMyJHL6Xd2uAIDahL4): the to-go place for our sales presentations <br><br>
